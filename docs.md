## Documentation

### What does this plugin do?

Stops customers from checking out with products from two different shipping classes in the same order. You choose what happens when someone tries to add a product with a different shipping class while one is already in their cart: either the new product gets blocked with a message, or their cart gets cleared first and the new product takes its place instead. Both messages are yours to write.

### How to set it up

1. Go to **WooCommerce > Settings > CartRules > One Shipping Class in Cart**.
2. Check **Enable restriction** to turn the feature on.
3. Under **When a different shipping class is added**, choose "Block the new product and show an error" or "Empty the cart first, then add the new product".
4. Edit the **Blocked message** shown to customers - use `{shipping_class}` anywhere you want the shipping class name to appear.
5. Edit the **Replaced message** shown when the cart gets cleared - same `{shipping_class}` placeholder works here too.
6. Click **Save changes**. The restriction applies immediately, on both the classic cart/checkout and the newer Cart and Checkout blocks.
